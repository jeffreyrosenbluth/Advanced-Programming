Communication On FaceIn
=========================
A social network implemented in Erlang with each person represented
as its own server.
by Jens Dahl Møllerhø

This is my hand in for the assignment found at [http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-e2014/facein/communication-facein.html]

The code can be compiled with `erl`.
Open `erl` and type `c(facein_spec).` and hit enter to load the program and the tests.
Type `facein_spec:tests().` to run the test suite.
